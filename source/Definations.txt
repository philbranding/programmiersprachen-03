Sequential Containers: takes linea time to search (Allows duplication)

The associative containers can be grouped into two subsets: maps and sets. A map, sometimes referred to as a dictionary, consists of a key/value pair. The key is used to order the sequence, and the value is somehow associated with that key. For example, a map might contain keys representing every unique word in a text and values representing the number of times that word appears in the text. A set is simply an ascending container of unique elements.

Both map and set only allow one instance of a key or element to be inserted into the container. If multiple instances of elements are required, use multimap or multiset.





Associative Containers:  refer to a group of class templates in the standard library of the C++ programming language that implement ordered associative arrays. eg. Maps and Sets (Order is important/ always sorted by a specific criteria) Log Time 





Difference : Associative containers are designed to be especially efficient in accessing its elements by their key, 
as opposed to sequence containers which are more efficient in accessing elements by their position.
